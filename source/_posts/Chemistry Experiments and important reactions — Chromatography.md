## Chromatography

- The reason why the color will change is that the solubility of different dyes are different in organic solution.
- Locating agent is used to let colorless dyes or compounds show color in order to indicate them.
- Dyes can be identified by comparison or calculating its Rf value.

- Precautions
    - Water level must beneath the start line
    - The paper must be perpendicular and be ringed

### Other related points

- Differences between m.p / b.p of pure substances and their mixtures
    - Pure substances have specific ****m.p / b.p
    - Melting point of mixtures of one pure substances and impurities is lower
    - Boiling point of mixtures of one pure substances and impurities is higher
    - Larger difference, larger amount of impurities
