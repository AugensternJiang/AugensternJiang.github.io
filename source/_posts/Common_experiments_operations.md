## Common experiments operations

### Filtration

- Filtration can be used to separate solid and liquid, which is often used to separate mixture of an insoluble and a soluble substance

### Crystallization

- Crystallization is used to obtain soluble substances from their solution like copper(Ⅱ) sulphate
- Crystallization often happens with fitration to get a relatively pure sustance

### Distillation

- Simple distillation

- Simple distillation can be used to separate the mixture of different kinds of liquid which the differences of boiling point are larger than 25℃
- In actual experiment, we use thermometer which is inserted in the flask to indicate whether a liquid is separated from the mixture

- Fractional distillation

- Fractional distillation is used to separate different kinds of liquid which the differences of their melting points are less than 25℃
- In actual experiment, we use thermometer which is inserted in the flask to indicate whether a liquid is separated from the mixture

### Titration

- Titration is used to indicate the concentration of an unknown solution, which is usually used in acid-base titration
- The actual end point of the titration usually adds slightly more amount of solution than it need to ensure the other solution is fully reacted
- In acid-base titration, we often use litmus, methyl orange and phenolphthalein as indicator.
