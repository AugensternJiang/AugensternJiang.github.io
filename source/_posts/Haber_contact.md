## Haber process

![Haber process](https://AugensternJiang.github.io/img/Haber_process.png)

- Condition
    - 450℃
    - 250 ATM
    - Iron as catalyst
- Sources of nitrogen
    - Fractional distillation of liquid air
- Sources of hydrogen
    - Cracking of petroleum

## Contact process

- 2 SO2(g) + O2(g) ⇌ 2 SO3(g)
    - Condition
        - 450℃
        - 1 - 2 ATM
        - Vanadium(V) oxide as catalyst
- H2SO4 (l) + SO3 (g) → H2S2O7 (l)
    - Produce oleum
- H2S2O7 (l) + H2O (l) → 2 H2SO4 (l)
    - Add water into oleum to form dilute sulphuric acid
