## Electrical chemistry

### Eletrical cell

- In electrical cell, anode is the negative electrode while cathode is the positive electrode
- The electrons transfer from anode to cathode
- The more reactive metal is usually anode
- Exothermic redox reaction must occur in electrical cell

### Electrolysis

- Usually, in electrolysis, anions will be attracted to anode and cations will be attracted to cathode
- The more important thing is the discharging series for cations and anions
    - Cations(Cathode)
        - Ag > Hg > Fe(III) > H > Pb > Sn > Fe(II) > Zn > H(water) > Al >Mg > Ca > Na > K
    - Anions(Anode)
        - S > I > Br > Cl > OH > -ate > F
- Also, concentration of ions can also influence its product

### Electroplating / Refining metals

- Electroplating is used to coat metals like iron, which can improve its ability to prevent from corrosion
- There is not a full reaction happens when elctroplating or refining metals
- There are only eletrons transferring in the circuit
